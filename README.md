# rock_paper_scissor
As we all love to play games so here its a Rock-Paper-Scissor game which a user can play with computer in realtime. 
<br/>
In this, computer generates a random image of rock, paper or scissor and simultaneously even the user has to show the choice he has made by describing it with his hand. A Deep learning model is
trained after preprocessing and Image Augmentation which predicts/understands the user's choice by seeing the image of his hand and based on the outcome the scores are calculated for the player and the computer.
